### Section 4: Detection Algorithm

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Auto-Selected Algorithm:                │
│  🔵 Wait-For Graph (WFG)                 │
│     All resources are single-instance    │
│                                          │
│  OR                                      │
│                                          │
│  🟣 Matrix-Based Detection               │
│     System has multi-instance resources  │
│                                          │
│  ℹ️ The system automatically selects     │
│     the optimal algorithm based on       │
│     your resource configuration.         │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**What it means:**
- The app **automatically** chooses the best algorithm
- Based on your resource instances

**Algorithm Selection:**
- **All resources have 1 instance each** → WFG algorithm
  - Example: R0=1, R1=1, R2=1
  - Faster, simpler
  - Detects cycles in wait-for graph
  
- **At least one resource has >1 instances** → Matrix algorithm
  - Example: R0=3, R1=2, R2=1
  - Handles quantities
  - Uses Work-Finish vectors

**You don't need to do anything!** The app decides for you.

### Section 5: Resource Types Table

```
┌──────────┬──────────────────┬───────────┐
│ Resource │ Total Instances  │ Available │
├──────────┼──────────────────┼───────────┤
│ R0       │ [3] ↑↓           │ 1         │
│ R1       │ [2] ↑↓           │ 0         │
│ R2       │ [4] ↑↓           │ 2         │
└──────────┴──────────────────┴───────────┘
```

**What each column means:**

**Resource:**
- Name of the resource type (R0, R1, R2, ...)
- Can be renamed in "Create New Problem"

**Total Instances:**
- How many copies of this resource exist
- **Editable** - click and type a number
- Use ↑↓ arrows to adjust

**Available:**
- How many are currently FREE (not allocated)
- **Auto-calculated**: Available = Total - Sum(Allocated)
- **Read-only** - updates automatically

**Example:**
```
Printer (R0):
Total: 3 printers exist
Currently allocated: 2 (P0 has 1, P1 has 1)
Available: 1 printer is free
```

**Tips:**
- If Available = 0 for all resources → Higher chance of deadlock
- Increase Total Instances to make more resources available

---

### Section 6: Allocation Matrix

```
Allocation Matrix
Resources currently held by each process

┌─────────┬────┬────┬────┐
│ Process │ R0 │ R1 │ R2 │
├─────────┼────┼────┼────┤
│ P0      │ [1]│ [0]│ [2]│
│ P1      │ [1]│ [1]│ [0]│
│ P2      │ [0]│ [1]│ [0]│
└─────────┴────┴────┴────┘
```

**What it means:**
- Shows what each process CURRENTLY HAS
- Each cell is **editable** - click and type

**Reading the matrix:**
```
Row P0: [1, 0, 2]
→ P0 currently holds:
  • 1 copy of R0
  • 0 copies of R1
  • 2 copies of R2
```

**How to edit:**
1. Click on any cell
2. Type a number (0 or positive)
3. Press Enter or click outside

**Auto-updates:**
- When you increase allocation → Available decreases
- When you decrease allocation → Available increases
- Maintains resource conservation: `Total = Available + Sum(Allocated)`

**Example scenario:**
```
Printer (R0) has 3 total instances

Allocation:
P0 has 1 printer
P1 has 1 printer
P2 has 0 printers

Sum = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 allocated
Available = 3 - 2 = 1 printer free ✓
```

---

### Section 7: Request Matrix

```
Request Matrix
Additional resources requested by each process

┌─────────┬────┬────┬────┐
│ Process │ R0 │ R1 │ R2 │
├─────────┼────┼────┼────┤
│ P0      │ [0]│ [1]│ [0]│
│ P1      │ [0]│ [0]│ [1]│
│ P2      │ [1]│ [0]│ [0]│
└─────────┴────┴────┴────┘
```

**What it means:**
- Shows what each process WANTS (but doesn't have yet)
- These are ADDITIONAL resources needed

**Reading the matrix:**
```
Row P0: [0, 1, 0]
→ P0 wants:
  • 0 more of R0 (already has enough)
  • 1 more of R1 (needs one more)
  • 0 more of R2 (already has enough)
```

**Important:**
- Request = Additional needs, NOT total needs
- If a process wants nothing, set all to 0
- Can't request more than what exists!

**Deadlock Example:**
```
Allocation: P0=[1,0], P1=[0,1]
Request:    P0=[0,1], P1=[1,0]

P0 holds R0, wants R1 (held by P1)
P1 holds R1, wants R0 (held by P0)
→ Circular wait → DEADLOCK!
```

---

### Section 8: Analyze Button

```
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│  🔍 Analyze for Deadlock         │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

**What it does:**
1. Validates all your data

## 📊 Visualization Tab - Detailed Guide

### Understanding the Graph

```
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                    │
│       ⚪ P0 ────────→ 🟣 R1        │
│        ↑              ↓            │
│        │              │            │
│       🟣 R0 ←──────── ⚪ P1        │
│                                    │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Node Types:**

**🔵 Blue Circles = Safe Processes**
- Can finish successfully
- Not involved in deadlock
- Will eventually complete

**🔴 Red Circles = Deadlocked Processes**
- Stuck in circular wait
- Cannot proceed
- Part of deadlock cycle

**🟣 Purple Circles = Resources**
- Resource types (R0, R1, R2, ...)
- Static (don't change color)

**Edge Types:**

**Green Solid Arrow (→) = Allocation**
- Direction: Resource → Process
- Meaning: "This process currently holds this resource"
- Example: R0 → P1 means "P1 has R0"

**Yellow Dashed Arrow (⇢) = Request**
- Direction: Process → Resource
- Meaning: "This process wants this resource"
- Example: P0 ⇢ R1 means "P0 wants R1"

### Reading Deadlock Patterns

**Circular Wait (Deadlock):**
```
P0 has R0, wants R1
P1 has R1, wants R2
P2 has R2, wants R0

Graph:
P0 → R1 → P1 → R2 → P2 → R0 → P0
↑_________________________________|
         (Full circle!)
```

**Safe State (No Deadlock):**
```
P0 wants nothing
P1 wants R0 (P0 can release it)
P2 wants R1 (available)

Graph:
P0 (no outgoing edges - can finish!)
P1 → R0 (can get it after P0 finishes)
P2 → R1 (can get it now)
```

Execution Time: 2.5 ms
Complexity: O(n² × m)
```

Shows which algorithm was used and performance metrics.

---

### Section 3: Detection Trace

**For WFG Algorithm:**
```
Detection Trace:
1. Building wait-for graph...
2. P0 wants R1, held by P1 → P0 waits for P1
3. P1 wants R2, held by P2 → P1 waits for P2
4. P2 wants R0, held by P0 → P2 waits for P0
5. Starting cycle detection from P0
6. Visiting P0 → P1 → P2 → P0 (cycle!)
7. DEADLOCK DETECTED
8. Cycle found: P0 → P1 → P2 → P0
```

**For Matrix Algorithm:**
```
Detection Trace:
1. Initializing: Work = [0, 0, 0], Finish = [F, F, F]
2. Iteration 1:
   - Checking P0: Request [1,1,0] > Work [0,0,0] ✗
   - Checking P1: Request [0,1,1] > Work [0,0,0] ✗
   - Checking P2: Request [1,0,1] > Work [0,0,0] ✗
3. No process can proceed
4. DEADLOCK DETECTED
5. Deadlocked processes: {P0, P1, P2}
```

**Educational value:**
- Shows step-by-step algorithm execution
- Helps understand how detection works
- Great for learning operating systems concepts

---

### Section 4: Safe Sequence (If No Deadlock)

```
Safe Sequence Found:
P0 → P2 → P1

Explanation:
1. P0 can finish (needs nothing)
2. P0 releases [1, 0, 1]
3. P2 can finish (enough resources now)
4. P2 releases [0, 1, 1]
5. P1 can finish (enough resources now)
6. All processes complete successfully!
```

Shows the order in which processes can safely complete.

---

### Section 5: Deadlock Cycles (If Deadlock Found)

```
Cycles Detected:
Cycle 1: P0 → P1 → P2 → P0
  • P0 waits for P1 (needs R1)
  • P1 waits for P2 (needs R2)
  • P2 waits for P0 (needs R0)
```

Shows all circular wait conditions found.

---

### Section 6: Recovery Strategies

**Strategy 1: Process Termination**
```
Option 1: Terminate {P0}
  • Cost: Kill 1 process
  • Effect: P1 can get R0, P2 can get R1
  • Pros: Breaks cycle immediately
  • Cons: P0 loses all progress

Option 2: Terminate {P1, P2}
  • Cost: Kill 2 processes
  • Effect: P0 can complete
  • Pros: P0 doesn't lose work
  • Cons: More processes affected
```

**Strategy 2: Resource Preemption**
```
Option 1: Preempt R1 from P1, give to P0
  • P0 completes and releases R0 and R1
  • P1 can then get R1 back and continue
  • Rollback P1 to safe state
  
Option 2: Preempt R0 from P0, give to P2
  • P2 completes and releases R0 and R2
  • P0 can then get R0 back and continue
```

**How to choose:**
- **Minimum cost?** → Terminate fewest processes
- **Preserve important work?** → Preempt instead of terminate
- **Fastest recovery?** → Terminate processes
- **Least disruption?** → Preempt resources

### Example 2: Verifying a Safe State

**Step 1: Load Sample**
- Click **"Simple Safe State"**

**You'll see:**
```
Processes: 3
Resources: 2 (R0 has 5, R1 has 3)

Available: [2, 1]

Allocation & Request:
P0: Has [2,0], Wants [1,2]
P1: Has [1,1], Wants [1,1]
P2: Has [0,1], Wants [2,1]
```

**Step 2: Analyze**
- Click **🔍 Analyze for Deadlock**

**Results:**
```
✅ NO DEADLOCK

Safe Sequence: P1 → P0 → P2

Explanation:
1. P1 can finish (needs [1,1], available [2,1])
2. P1 releases [1,1] → available becomes [3,2]
3. P0 can finish (needs [1,2], available [3,2])
4. P0 releases [2,0] → available becomes [5,2]
5. P2 can finish (needs [2,1], available [5,2])
```

  - P0 = "Browser"
  - P1 = "Editor"
  - R0 = "RAM" (4 instances)
  - R1 = "CPU" (2 instances)
- Click **➕ Create Problem**

**Step 2: Set Allocation**
```
Browser: [2, 1] (has 2 RAM, 1 CPU)
Editor:  [1, 0] (has 1 RAM, 0 CPU)
```

**Step 3: Set Requests**
```
Browser: [0, 1] (wants 1 more CPU)
Editor:  [2, 1] (wants 2 RAM, 1 CPU)
```

**Step 4: Analyze**
- Click **🔍 Analyze for Deadlock**
- See if they're deadlocked!

**Current Available:**
```
RAM: 4 - (2+1) = 1 free

Available: [1, 1]
```

**Can Editor proceed?**
```
Editor wants [2, 1]
Available: [1, 1]
2 > 1 for RAM → NO! ✗
```

**Can Browser proceed?**
```
Browser wants [0, 1]
Available: [1, 1]
0 ≤ 1 and 1 ≤ 1 → YES! ✓
```

**Result:** NO DEADLOCK (Browser can finish first)
